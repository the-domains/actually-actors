Since we started in 2006 we have worked directly with over 150 charities ranging from national charities such as Sparks and SANDS to many local hospices for example Woking & Sam Beare Hospice and Barnsley Hospice.

**Here is what some of our clients said:**

_"The manual processing of our JustGiving donations had always been a very complex and time-consuming procedure for us -- often taking more than 2 days a week. The application supplied to us last year by Anthony means our income processing team now takes around Â½ day each week to customise and process all of our JustGiving donations. Anthony has also installed a similar automated process for our Virgin Money Giving donations.__There was an obvious strategic and operational benefit for us to move from manual input to automation as the time -- and cost -- saving has allowed us to use our resources more efficiently."_  
**Elice Craske,**Fundraising Income Support Manager, Motor Neurone Disease Association

_"Anthony did a great job providing IT training and support to my client. The feedback was universally positive and colleagues are now confident to carry out the functions he taught them. I would have no hesitation in recommending Anthony to any of my clients and commend him for excellent work."_  
**David Kelham**, hired Anthony as an IT Training and Support in 2008 at AOL Europe

_"I would not hesitate to recommend Anthony as a partner for any charity addressing their data needs. His understanding of the technicalities of data manipulation and optimisation is impressive and perfectly supported by his ability to see the bigger picture and work flexibly with the differing needs, structures and timescales which affect any data project. He is well connected within the network of non-profit technology professionals and is able to draw on a wide range of experience to deliver a project big or small. His dedication to his clients and to the best possible outcomes is a great asset when taking on a big project and his ability to hit the ground running is fantastic when you need an issue solved quickly and painlessly.."_  
**Catryn Ladd**-- Fundraising & Communication Manager at The Challenging Behaviour Foundation

_"I attended a training session delivered by Anthony. I found him to be an excellent public speaker, trainer and facilitator. The topics we were covering were quite complex but Anthony managed to make them accessible to all participants. I would have no hesitation in recommending Anthony.."_
